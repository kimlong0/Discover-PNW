## INFO 340 Project 
Section BA, Group 6 

By Kimlong Nguyen, Emily Eckey, Maxim Arzumanov, and Maxwell London

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. This Discover PNW is a Pacific Northwest centered interactive web application. The website allows the user to record and measure their exploration of the PNW with a dynamic score and achievement system. The users of the application are those interested in documenting their travel journey and activities and learning more information about other opportunities. Individuals both from the PNW passionate about exploring or visitors wanting to find unique activities and locations will be accessing the website. Other common social-media platforms have the ability to share a user's exploration of the PNW, but lack a permanent record of their travels.

This interactive travel app allows users to:
1. Filter by type of activity within Seattle and the PNW. Filtering provides more precise recommendations based on the user's interests. Filters include nature, city, landmark, and event.
2. Users can save adventures they would like to complete to their "My Adventures" for future reference and use.
3. Users can log in with their personal information to have their own profile where they can track their completed adventures. Their profile includes their adventure medals they have earned and they can edit their profile information such as their name and photo at any time by editing the form.

This app helps to solve the problem of people not having a way to reflect on their travels of unique and memorable adventures in a measurable way by creating a reflective, welcoming, and inclusive platform. The features allow for an engaging achievement system where users can document their progress toward visiting locations around the PNW. The highlighted adventures include opportunities for users to explore to acknowledge the native land they are visiting.
